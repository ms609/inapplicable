#' @param nCores the number of CPU cores (processors) to employ.  As it takes a couple of seconds to set up additional
#'               cores, you are only likely to benefit from using multiple cores when performing 
#'               long searches on large trees.  Determine the number of available cores using 
#'               \code{parallel::\link[parallel]{detectCores}}.
