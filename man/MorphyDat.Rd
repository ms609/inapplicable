\usage{
MorphyDat(phydat)
}
\arguments{
\item{phydat}{A \code{phyDat} object}
}
\value{
This function returns a matrix of class \code{*phyDat}.
   \itemize{
\item     Each row of the matrix corresponds to an operational taxonomic unit;
\item     Each column of the matrix represents a transformation series, with all transformation
          series containing three or more inapplicable tokens (and thus requiring the use of the 
          modified Fitch algorithm) listed first;
\item     Each cell in the matrix contains an integer that denotes the possible tokens.
          This integer is the decimal representation of the binary figure represented by a row
          in the contrast matrix (in reverse order), after
          phangorn:::prepareFitchData.          
  }
  In addition to the standard \link{phyDat} attributes, the returned object bears an attribute
  \code{inapp.level}, specifying the level that corresponds to the inapplicable token, \code{
  inapp.chars}, specifying the number of transformation series in which three or more inapplicable
  tokens are present (thus requiring the use of the modified Fitch algorithm), and [#TODO]
  \code{min.steps}, specifying the minimum number of steps necessary to obtain the observed
  distribution of tokens (necessary when calculating implied weights).
